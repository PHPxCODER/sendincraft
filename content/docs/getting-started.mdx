# Getting Started

Welcome to SendinCraft! This guide will help you send your first transactional email in under 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:
- A SendinCraft account ([sign up here](https://sendincraft.com))
- A verified email address
- A domain you want to send emails from

## Step 1: Create Your Account

1. Visit [sendincraft.com](https://sendincraft.com) and click "Sign Up"
2. Enter your email address and create a password
3. Verify your email address by clicking the link we send you

<Callout type="info">
  You'll receive a welcome email with your account confirmation and next steps.
</Callout>

## Step 2: Verify Your Sending Domain

To send emails from your domain, you need to verify ownership:

### Add DNS Records

Add these DNS records to your domain:

```txt
# SPF Record (TXT)
Name: @
Value: v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all

# DKIM Records (CNAME)
Name: _domainkey.yourdomain.com
Value: _domainkey.amazonses.com

# DMARC Record (TXT)
Name: _dmarc
Value: v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@yourdomain.com
```

<Callout type="warning">
  DNS propagation can take up to 48 hours. We'll notify you once verification is complete.
</Callout>

### Verify in Dashboard

1. Go to your [SendinCraft Dashboard](https://app.sendincraft.com/domains)
2. Click "Add Domain"
3. Enter your domain name
4. Follow the DNS setup instructions
5. Click "Verify Domain"

## Step 3: Get Your API Keys

1. Navigate to [API Keys](https://app.sendincraft.com/api-keys) in your dashboard
2. Click "Create New API Key"
3. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Production API Key")
4. Copy and securely store your API key

<Callout type="danger">
  **Keep your API keys secure!** Never commit them to version control or share them publicly.

          subject: 'Welcome to our platform!',

  <Tab value="python" title="Python">
    ```python
    import os
    from sendincraft import SendinCraft

    client = SendinCraft(api_key=os.getenv('SENDINCRAFT_API_KEY'))

    def send_welcome_email():
        try:
            result = client.emails.send(
                from_email='welcome@yourdomain.com',

        "from": "welcome@yourdomain.com",
        "to": "user@example.com",
        "subject": "Welcome to our platform!",
        "html": "<h1>Welcome!</h1><p>Thanks for signing up!</p>",
        "text": "Welcome! Thanks for signing up."
      }'
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 6: Check Email Status

Monitor your email delivery:

```javascript
// Get email status
const email = await client.emails.get('email_id_here');
console.log('Email status:', email.status);

// List recent emails
const emails = await client.emails.list({ limit: 10 });
emails.data.forEach(email => {
  console.log(`${email.id}: ${email.status}`);
});
```

## Environment Variables

For security, store your API key as an environment variable:

```bash
# .env file
SENDINCRAFT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

<Callout type="info">
  **Best Practice:** Use different API keys for development, staging, and production environments.
</Callout>
